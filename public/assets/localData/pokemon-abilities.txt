If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way.\n\nAbilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user.  This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle.  This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.\n\nAn ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.\n\nWhen this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.\n\nThis ability functions identically to teravolt and turboblaze."},{"_id":"105","_rev":"1-27d6c2df89a7265a66afe1db26cb84f3","name":"super-luck","description":"The Pokémon is so lucky that the critical-hit ratios\nof its moves are boosted.","effect":"Raises moves' critical hit rates one stage.","in_depth_effect":"This Pokémon's moves have critical hit rates one stage higher than normal."},{"_id":"109","_rev":"1-fbf776348d2a6b6cb063abe27113781e","name":"unaware","description":"When attacking, the Pokémon ignores the target\nPokémon’s stat changes.","effect":"Ignores other Pokémon's stat modifiers for damage and accuracy calculation.","in_depth_effect":"This Pokémon ignores other Pokémon's stat modifiers for the purposes of damage and accuracy calculation.\n\nEffectively, this affects modifiers of every stat except Speed.\n\nThe power of punishment and stored power is calculated as usual.
